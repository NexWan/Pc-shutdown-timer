# Pc-shutdown-timer
This is a program where u enter a time as an input in seconds and will reproduce a video 5 minutes or before of the shutdown time and give u a message that ur pc will 
shutdown, pretty useless but its funny, does the same function as a simple bash but i wanted to do something funny it contains 2 videos at the moment and the cat video 
for some reason refuse to work if i dont let that white strip to its right, might upload more vids later, or maybe add a personal video uploader there so anyone can add
it locally, idk.
