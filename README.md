# Pc-shutdown-timer
This is a program where u enter a time as an input in seconds and will reproduce a video 5 minutes or less and give u a message that ur pc will shutdown, 
pretty useless but its funny, does the same function as a simple bash but i wanted to do something funny
it contains 2 videos at the moment and the cat video for some reason refuse to work if i dont let that white strip to its left
i might upload more vids lately, or maybe add a personal video uploader there so u can add it locally, idk.
